Main Game Document

-My game is going to be a third person platformer game. In which the main aim of the game is to try and collect a set amount
of coins/gems to proceed to the next level.

-The level(s) will be straight forward to navigate through.

-Gems/coins will be scattered throughout the level which the player needs to collect to complete the level.

-I will have some enemies in the level(s) which will hopefully add some difficulty to the game.
